**Accuracy** is the number of correct predictions made by the model over all kinds predictions made

> Accuracy = ( TP + TN ) / ( TP + FN + FP + TN )

**Precision** determines the fraction of records that actually turns out to be positive in the group the classifier has declared as a positive class

> Percision = TP / ( TP + FP )

**Truth positive rate** (**TPR**) [**sensitivity**|**Recall**|**灵敏度**] is defined as the fraction of positive examples predicted correctly

> TPR = TP / ( TP + FN )

**Truth negative rate** (**TNR**) [**specificity**|**特指度**] is defined as the fraction of negative examples predicted correctly

> TNR = TN / ( TN + FP )

**False positive rate** (**FPR**) is defined as the fraction of negative examples predicted as a positive class

> FPR = FP / ( FP + TN )

**False negative rate** (**FNR**) is defined as the fraction of positive examples predicted as a negative class

> FNR = FN / ( FN + TP )

**Weighted Accuracy**

> Weighted Accuracy = ( w1\*TP + w4\*TN ) / ( w1\*TP + w2\*FP + w3\*FN + w4\*TN )

# the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve

A Receiver Operating Characteristic (**ROC**) curve is a graphical approach for displaying the tradeoff between TPR and FPR of a classifier.
The area under the ROC curve (**AUC**) provides anthor approach for evaluating which model is better on average.
